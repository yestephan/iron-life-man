# Build Verification

After completing any coding task, **always run a build check** before finishing:

1. Run `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`) to ensure the Next.js app compiles without errors
2. If build fails, fix the errors before considering the work complete
3. Optionally run `pnpm type-check` for faster TypeScript validation during iteration

Do not mark work as complete until the build passes.
